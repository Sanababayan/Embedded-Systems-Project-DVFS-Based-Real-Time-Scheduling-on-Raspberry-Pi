# Embedded Systems Project: DVFS-Based Real-Time Scheduling on Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project addresses power management in embedded systems by implementing **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)** combined with **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** scheduling on a multi-core Raspberry Pi. The goal is to reduce power consumption without violating real-time constraints, making it suitable for energy-sensitive applications.

By dynamically adjusting CPU frequency based on task deadlines and system workload, the system achieves improved energy efficiency while maintaining real-time performance.
